# Resend Verification Email Fix

## Problem

The "Resend verification email" button on the `/verify-email` page was not functional - it had no click handler or API integration.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Verify Email Page (`src/app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Added client-side functionality with React state management
- ✅ Added email input field that appears when user clicks resend button
- ✅ Added proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ Integrated with custom API endpoint for resending emails
- ✅ Added user-friendly success/error messages with toast notifications

### 2. Created Resend Verification API (`src/app/api/auth/send-verification-email/route.ts`)

- ✅ Custom API endpoint to handle resend verification requests
- ✅ Validates email address and checks if user exists
- ✅ Handles already verified users gracefully
- ✅ Generates proper verification URLs
- ✅ Integrates with existing email service
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Fixed Email Service (`src/server/email.ts`)

- ✅ Resolved TypeScript errors in email service
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Removed unused imports

## Features

### User Experience

- **Smart Email Input**: Only shows email input field when needed
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during email sending process
- **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different scenarios:
  - Invalid email address
  - User not found
  - Already verified users
  - Server errors
- **Success Feedback**: Clear confirmation when email is sent

### Technical Features

- **Database Integration**: Queries user table to validate requests
- **Email Verification**: Integrates with existing email service
- **Security**: Validates all inputs and handles edge cases
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/auth/send-verification-email`

Resends verification email to specified user.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Responses:**

- `200`: Email sent successfully or already verified
- `400`: Invalid email address
- `404`: User not found
- `500`: Server error

## Usage

1. User visits `/verify-email` page after signup
2. If they don't receive the email, they click "Resend verification email"
3. System prompts for email address
4. User enters email and clicks resend
5. System validates user exists and sends new verification email
6. User receives confirmation message

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
# Start development server first
npm run dev

# Run test in another terminal
npx tsx scripts/test-resend-verification.ts
```

The test verifies:

- ✅ Resend works for unverified users
- ✅ Proper error handling for non-existent users
- ✅ Correct handling of already verified users
- ✅ API endpoint responds correctly

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **User not found**: Returns 404 with helpful message
2. **Already verified**: Returns success message without sending email
3. **Invalid email**: Returns 400 with validation error
4. **Email service failure**: Returns 500 with generic error message
5. **Network issues**: Client-side error handling with retry option

## Security Considerations

- Email addresses are validated and sanitized
- User existence is checked before sending emails
- No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- Rate limiting can be added in the future if needed

The resend verification email functionality is now fully operational and provides a smooth user experience for email verification.

## 🔄 Role Transition and Management

### Role Assignment Process

**Role Changes:**

1. Manager or Admin identifies need for role change
2. Admin updates user role in system
3. User's permissions automatically update
4. User receives notification of role change
5. User may need to log out/in to see full changes

### Best Practices for Role Management

**For Admins:**

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Role-Based Security

**Data Access Control:**

- Users only see data appropriate for their role
- Document access controlled by permissions
- Tender visibility based on assignment and sharing
- Audit trails track all user activities

**Feature Access Control:**

- UI elements hidden/shown based on role
- API endpoints validate user permissions
- Database queries filtered by user role
- File operations restricted by permissions

### Permission Inheritance

**Hierarchical Access:**

```
Admin (Full Access)
  ↓
Manager (Portfolio Access)
  ↓
Specialist (Assigned Access)
  ↓
Viewer (Read-Only Access)
```

**Cross-Role Collaboration:**

- Specialists can share tenders with other roles
- Managers can assign access to team members
- Admins can override access restrictions when needed
- Viewers can be granted specific document access

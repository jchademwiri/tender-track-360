## Implementation Order

### ✅ **Recommended Sequence:**

1. **Phase 0**: Database Design (Week 0)

   - Set up Better Auth with organizations
   - Create enhanced schema with multi-tenancy
   - Implement audit trails

2. **Phase 1**: Core Foundation (Week 1-2)

   - Build on Phase 0 database foundation
   - Implement core tender management
   - Add basic file upload with UploadThing

3. **Continue with Phases 2-5** as previously planned

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 0**: `phase-0-database-design/tasks.md`
2. **Set up Better Auth** with organization support
3. **Create enhanced database schema** with all improvements
4. **Move to Phase 1** with solid foundation in place

The database foundation is now properly designed for scalability, multi-tenancy, and comprehensive audit trails while supporting the complete tender management lifecycle.

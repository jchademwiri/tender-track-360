# User Database Analysis - What's Missing

**Generated**: August 14, 2025  
**Analysis**: Current user database structure and missing components for Tender Track 360

## üîç **Current State**

You currently have only the **basic Better Auth tables**:

- `user` - Basic user info (id, name, email, emailVerified, image)
- `session` - User sessions
- `account` - OAuth accounts
- `verification` - Email verification tokens

## ‚ùå **Critical Missing Components**

### 1. **Organization/Multi-Tenancy Support**

```typescript
// MISSING: Organization tables
organization: {
  (id, name, slug, domain, settings, subscription_plan, created_at, updated_at);
}

member: {
  (id, user_id, organization_id, role, invited_by, joined_at, status);
}

invitation: {
  (id, email, organization_id, role, invited_by, expires_at, status);
}
```

**Impact**: Without this, you can't have proper multi-tenant isolation. All users would share the same data, which is not suitable for a business application where different organizations need separate tender data.

### 2. **Extended User Profile Data**

```typescript
// MISSING: User profiles with business context
user_profiles: {
  (id,
    user_id,
    organization_id,
    department,
    job_title,
    phone,
    role,
    permissions,
    is_active,
    last_login,
    onboarding_completed);
}
```

**Impact**: The current user table only has basic auth info. You need business context like department, job title, and organization-specific roles for proper tender management workflows.

### 3. **User Preferences & Settings**

```typescript
// MISSING: User preferences
user_preferences: {
  (id,
    user_id,
    email_notifications,
    push_notifications,
    reminder_days,
    timezone,
    language,
    date_format,
    time_format,
    theme);
}
```

**Impact**: Users can't customize their experience, notification preferences, or display settings. This is essential for a professional business application.

### 4. **Audit & Activity Tracking**

```typescript
// MISSING: User activity logs
user_activity_logs: {
  (id,
    user_id,
    organization_id,
    action,
    resource_type,
    resource_id,
    ip_address,
    user_agent,
    timestamp);
}
```

**Impact**: No audit trail for compliance and security. In tender management, you need to track who did what and when for accountability.

### 5. **Tender-Specific User Data**

```typescript
// MISSING: Tender-related user extensions
user_tender_assignments: {
  (id, user_id, tender_id, role, assigned_by, assigned_at, status);
}

user_notifications: {
  (id, user_id, type, title, message, read_at, tender_id, created_at);
}
```

**Impact**: Can't assign users to specific tenders or send targeted notifications about tender deadlines and updates.

## üö® **Immediate Priorities**

### **High Priority (Must Have)**

1. **Enable Better Auth Organization Plugin** - This gives you multi-tenancy
   - Automatically creates organization, member, and invitation tables
   - Provides built-in organization management APIs
   - Essential for business applications

2. **User Profiles Table** - Extended business information
   - Links users to organizations with business context
   - Stores department, job title, and organization-specific roles
   - Enables proper access control

3. **User Preferences** - Notification and display settings
   - Customizable user experience
   - Notification preferences for tender deadlines
   - Timezone and language settings

### **Medium Priority (Should Have)**

4. **User Activity Logs** - Audit trail
   - Compliance and security requirements
   - Track user actions on tenders
   - Debugging and analytics

5. **User Notifications** - In-app notification system
   - Tender deadline reminders
   - Status change notifications
   - Assignment notifications

### **Future (Nice to Have)**

6. **User Tender Assignments** - Tender-specific roles
   - Assign users to specific tenders
   - Role-based permissions per tender
   - Workload distribution

7. **User Performance Metrics** - Success rates, activity stats
   - Track user performance on tenders
   - Analytics for team management
   - Performance dashboards

## üîß **Technical Implementation Notes**

### Current Auth Configuration Issue

The organization plugin is commented out in `src/lib/auth.ts`:

```typescript
// import { organization } from 'better-auth/plugins';
```

This needs to be enabled to get multi-tenancy support.

### Database Schema Location

Current schema is minimal in `src/db/schema/auth.ts` - only basic Better Auth tables exist.

### Missing Foreign Key Relationships

No relationships between users and business entities like organizations, which is critical for data isolation.

## üí° **Recommended Implementation Order**

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

1. **Enable Better Auth Organization Plugin**
   - Uncomment and configure organization plugin
   - Run migrations to create org tables
   - Update auth configuration

2. **Create User Profiles Schema**
   - Design user_profiles table
   - Add foreign key relationships
   - Create helper functions

### Phase 2: User Experience (Week 2)

3. **Add User Preferences**
   - Create preferences table
   - Build preferences UI
   - Implement notification settings

4. **Basic Activity Logging**
   - Create activity logs table
   - Add logging middleware
   - Basic audit trail

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3+)

5. **Notification System**
   - In-app notifications
   - Email notification templates
   - Notification preferences

6. **Tender Assignments**
   - User-tender relationships
   - Assignment workflows
   - Permission management

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

After implementing these components, you should have:

- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant organization support
- ‚úÖ Rich user profiles with business context
- ‚úÖ Customizable user preferences
- ‚úÖ Audit trail for compliance
- ‚úÖ Foundation for tender-specific features

## üöÄ **Next Action Items**

1. **Immediate**: Enable Better Auth organization plugin
2. **This Week**: Create user profiles table with organization relationships
3. **Next Week**: Add user preferences and basic activity logging
4. **Future**: Build notification system and tender assignments

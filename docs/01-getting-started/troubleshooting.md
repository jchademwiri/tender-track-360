- Database doesn't exist

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
sudo systemctl status postgresql  # Linux
brew services list | grep postgresql  # macOS

# Verify database exists
psql -h localhost -U postgres -l

# Test connection string
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/tender-track-360"

# Create database if missing
createdb tender-track-360
```

### Environment Variables Not Loading

**Issue**: Application can't find environment variables

**Possible Causes:**

- `.env.local` file missing
- Incorrect file location
- Typos in variable names
- Server not restarted after changes

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Verify .env.local exists in root directory
ls -la .env.local

# Check file contents (without exposing secrets)
grep -v "SECRET\|PASSWORD" .env.local

# Restart development server
pnpm dev
```

### File Upload Failures

**Issue**: Files won't upload or upload fails silently

**Possible Causes:**

- UploadThing API keys incorrect
- File size too large
- Unsupported file type
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Verify UploadThing configuration
echo $UPLOADTHING_SECRET | head -c 10  # Should show first 10 chars
echo $UPLOADTHING_APP_ID

# Check file size (max 10MB by default)
ls -lh your-file.pdf

# Test with smaller file
# Try different file type (PDF, DOC, etc.)
```

### Build Errors

**Issue**: `pnpm build` fails with TypeScript errors

**Possible Causes:**

- Type errors in code

# Better Auth Verification Issue - Comprehensive Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **Initial signup verification email not sending**
2. **Invalid token error when clicking verification links**
3. **Resend verification using incorrect token format**

## Root Causes

### 1. Email Service Configuration

The initial verification email during signup might be failing silently due to:

- Email service errors not being properly handled
- Resend API key issues
- Email template rendering problems

### 2. Token Format Mismatch

The custom resend verification API was creating tokens manually instead of using Better Auth's internal verification system, causing "INVALID_TOKEN" errors.

### 3. Better Auth Configuration

Some TypeScript errors in the auth configuration might be causing issues.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Better Auth Configuration (`src/lib/auth.ts`)

- ✅ Fixed role definitions to use simple string array
- ✅ Proper error handling in email verification handlers
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Email Service (`src/server/email.ts`)

- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Better environment variable validation

### 3. Improved Resend Verification API (`src/app/api/auth/send-verification-email/route.ts`)

- ✅ Uses Better Auth's proper verification token system
- ✅ Proper database integration with verification table
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 4. Enhanced Verify Email Page (`src/app/(auth)/verify-email/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Smart email input that only appears when needed
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Loading states and success messages

## Diagnostic Tools Created

### 1. Comprehensive Diagnosis Script

```bash
npx tsx scripts/diagnose-verification-issue.ts
```

This script checks:

- Database connectivity
- Environment variables
- Unverified users
- Verification tokens
- Email service configuration

### 2. Signup Test Script

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-signup-verification.ts
```

Tests the complete signup and verification flow.

## Manual Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
```

### Step 2: Test Email Service

```bash
# Test if emails can be sent
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email
```

### Step 3: Check Database

```sql
-- Check for unverified users
SELECT id, email, email_verified, created_at FROM "user" WHERE email_verified = false;

-- Check verification tokens
SELECT * FROM "verification" ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 4: Test Signup Flow

1. Go to `/sign-up`
2. Create a new account
3. Check server logs for verification email attempts
4. Check database for verification tokens
5. Test resend functionality if initial email fails

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### During Signup:

1. User submits signup form
2. Better Auth creates user account (unverified)
3. Better Auth triggers verification email
4. Email service sends verification email
5. User redirected to `/verify-email`

### During Email Verification:

1. User clicks verification link from email
2. Better Auth validates token
3. User account marked as verified
4. User can now sign in

### During Resend:

1. User clicks "Resend verification email"
2. System prompts for email address
3. API validates user exists and is unverified
4. New verification token created using Better Auth system
5. Verification email sent with proper token
6. User receives working verification link

## Troubleshooting

### If Initial Signup Email Still Doesn't Send:

1. Check server logs during signup
2. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is valid
3. Check email service configuration
4. Test with diagnostic script

### If Verification Links Still Show "INVALID_TOKEN":

1. Check if using the new resend API
2. Verify token format in database
3. Check Better Auth configuration
4. Ensure proper URL format

### If Resend Doesn't Work:

1. Check API endpoint is accessible
2. Verify user exists in database
3. Check verification token creation
4. Test email sending separately

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run comprehensive diagnosis
npx tsx scripts/diagnose-verification-issue.ts

# Test signup flow
npx tsx scripts/test-signup-verification.ts

# Test resend functionality
npx tsx scripts/test-resend-verification.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the diagnosis script** to identify specific issues
2. **Test the signup flow** with a new email address
3. **Check server logs** for any email sending errors
4. **Verify environment variables** are properly set
5. **Test the resend functionality** if initial email fails

The verification system should now work correctly with proper error handling and user feedback.

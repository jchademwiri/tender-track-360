## 2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION - Define Tech Stack and Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack Decisions & Rationale

#### **Frontend Technology**

```
Decision: Next.js 15 with App Router
Rationale:
- Server-side rendering for better performance
- Built-in API routes reduce complexity
- TypeScript support for better code quality
- Large community and good documentation
- Supports our requirement for role-based routing

Alternative Considered: React + Express (rejected due to increased complexity)
```

#### **Database & ORM**

```
Decision: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
Rationale:
- PostgreSQL handles complex relationships in tender data
- Drizzle provides type-safe database queries
- Schema migrations are version controlled
- Performance scales with business growth

Alternative Considered: MySQL + Prisma (rejected due to PostgreSQL's advanced features)
```

#### **Authentication Strategy**

```
Decision: NextAuth.js with JWT + Database Sessions
Rationale:
- Industry standard for Next.js applications
- Supports multiple authentication providers (future expansion)
- Built-in security best practices
- Session management handles role-based access

Alternative Considered: Custom JWT implementation (rejected due to security complexity)
```

#### **Styling & UI Framework**

```
Decision: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui Components
Rationale:
- Rapid prototyping and consistent design
- Utility-first approach reduces CSS complexity
- Shadcn provides accessible, professional components
- Easy customization for brand requirements

Alternative Considered: Material-UI (rejected due to bundle size)
```

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 2.3 Security Architecture

```
Authentication Flow:
1. User submits credentials → 2. Server validates → 3. JWT token issued
4. Token stored in httpOnly cookie → 5. Middleware validates on each request
6. Role-based access control applied → 7. User sees appropriate interface
```

### 2.4 Action Steps for Technical Specification

**Day 1: Architecture Decisions**

- [ ] Research and compare authentication libraries
- [ ] Design database schema for authentication tables
- [ ] Plan API endpoint structure
- [ ] Define security requirements and implementation approach

**Day 2: Technology Validation**

- [ ] Create proof-of-concept for NextAuth.js integration
- [ ] Test Drizzle ORM with your database schema
- [ ] Validate Tailwind CSS build process
- [ ] Ensure all technologies work together

**Day 3: Documentation & Review**

- [ ] Document all architectural decisions with rationale
- [ ] Create system diagrams showing data flow
- [ ] Define coding standards and conventions
- [ ] Get technical review from senior developers

## 3. USER STORIES - Understand User Needs for Authentication

### 3.1 User Story Creation Process

#### **Step 1: User Role Definition**

Based on your database schema:

- **Admin**: System administrator with full access
- **Tender Manager**: Strategic oversight, team management
- **Tender Specialist**: Day-to-day tender operations
- **Viewer**: Read-only access for reporting/monitoring

#### **Step 2: Authentication User Stories**

**Epic: User Authentication**

```
US-001: Basic Login
As any system user
I want to log in with my email and password
So that I can access the tender management system

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I have valid credentials in the system
- When I enter my email and password on the login page
- Then I should be authenticated and redirected to my role-appropriate dashboard
- And my session should remain active for 8 hours of inactivity
- And invalid credentials should show a clear error message

Priority: Must Have
Effort: 8 story points
```

```
US-002: Role-Based Dashboard Access
As a [specific role]
I want to see only the navigation and features relevant to my role
So that I can efficiently access the tools I need without confusion

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am logged in as an Admin
- When I access the dashboard
- Then I should see admin-specific menu items (User Management, System Settings, etc.)
- And I should not see specialist-only features
- And the same logic applies for all 4 roles with their respective permissions

Priority: Must Have
Effort: 13 story points
```

```
US-003: Secure Session Management
As any system user
I want my session to be secure and automatically logged out when inactive
So that unauthorized users cannot access my account

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am logged into the system
- When I am inactive for 8 hours
- Then I should be automatically logged out
- And when I close my browser and return, I should remain logged in (if within 8 hours)
- And when I manually log out, my session should be completely terminated

Priority: Must Have
Effort: 5 story points
```

```
US-004: Password Reset
As any system user
I want to reset my password if I forget it
So that I can regain access to my account without admin intervention

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I have forgotten my password
- When I click "Forgot Password" and enter my email
- Then I should receive a secure reset link via email
- And the link should expire after 1 hour
- And after resetting, my old password should no longer work

Priority: Should Have
Effort: 8 story points
```

### 3.2 User Journey Mapping

#### **New User First Login Journey**

```
1. User receives login credentials from admin
2. User navigates to login page
3. User enters credentials
4. System validates and creates session
5. User is redirected to role-specific dashboard
6. User sees welcome message and basic navigation
7. User explores available features based on role
```

#### **Returning User Journey**

```
1. User navigates to application URL
2. System checks for existing valid session
3a. If valid: Direct to dashboard
3b. If invalid: Redirect to login page
4. User continues with normal workflow
```

### 3.3 Action Steps for User Stories

**Day 1: User Research**

- [ ] Interview 2-3 users from each role about current authentication pain points
- [ ] Document current login/access workflows
- [ ] Identify security concerns and requirements
- [ ] Understand integration needs with existing systems

**Day 2: Story Creation**

- [ ] Write detailed user stories using the template above
- [ ] Create acceptance criteria for each story
- [ ] Estimate effort using story points or hours
- [ ] Prioritize stories using MoSCoW method (Must/Should/Could/Won't)

**Day 3: Validation & Refinement**

- [ ] Review stories with stakeholders
- [ ] Validate acceptance criteria with end users
- [ ] Refine stories based on feedback
- [ ] Create story backlog in your project management tool

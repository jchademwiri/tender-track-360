I've created a comprehensive breakdown of all the project management documents you'll need for Phase 1. Here's what you should prioritize:

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Start This Week):**

1. **Project Charter** - Get stakeholder buy-in and clear objectives
2. **Technical Specification** - Define your tech stack and architecture decisions
3. **User Stories** - Ensure you understand user needs for authentication
4. **Work Breakdown Structure** - Break down the 2-3 weeks into actionable tasks

## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**

**Week 0 (Pre-Development):**

- Complete stakeholder alignment with Project Charter
- Finalize technical architecture decisions
- Create detailed user stories for authentication flows
- Set up development environment requirements

**Week 1-2 (During Development):**

- Maintain sprint planning documents
- Track progress against WBS
- Document API endpoints as you build them
- Continuously update test cases

**Week 3 (Completion):**

- Complete technical documentation for handover to Phase 2
- Conduct user acceptance testing
- Document lessons learned

## **PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Start Small**: Don't try to create all documents at once. Focus on the "IMMEDIATE" priority documents first.

2. **Living Documents**: Keep documents updated as you develop - don't treat them as "write once, forget" artifacts.

3. **Template Reuse**: The templates I've provided can be reused for all subsequent phases with minor modifications.

4. **Tool Selection**: Choose tools your team will actually use. Simple Google Docs might be better than complex project management software if your team is small.

5. **Stakeholder Review**: Get key stakeholders to review and sign off on the Project Charter and Technical Specification before writing any code.

Would you like me to create detailed templates for any of these specific documents, or dive deeper into the technical architecture decisions you'll need to make for Phase 1?

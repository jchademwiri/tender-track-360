## File Upload Strategy

### Document Types for MVP:

2. **Submitted Tender Scans** (Phase 3): Scanned copies of submitted tender documents
3. **Tender Extensions** (Phase 3): Extension request documents and approvals

### UploadThing Folder Structure:

```
/organization-name/
  â”œâ”€â”€ tender-{id}/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tender-notice/          # Original tender documents
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ technical-specs/        # Technical specifications
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ financial-proposal/     # Financial and pricing documents
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ legal-documents/        # Legal and compliance documents
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ correspondence/         # Email and communication records
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ submissions/            # Final submitted documents
```

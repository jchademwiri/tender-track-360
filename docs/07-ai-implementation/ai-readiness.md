**Key Data Extraction:**

| Field                | Method            | Example                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Tender Number        | Regex + LLM       | A-EWM 02-2025                 |
| Closing Date         | Date parser       | 27 Aug 2025 – 10:00           |
| Requirements         | Table parsing     | Equipment, licenses, finances |
| Financial Thresholds | Currency regex    | R200,000, R100,000            |
| Evaluation Method    | Formula detection | 90/10 Price/Goals system      |

**AI Prompt Template:**

```
You are an expert tender compliance officer.

- B-BBEE Certificates
- Municipal Accounts
- Financial Statements
- Equipment (ENATIS, Asset registers)
- Licenses & Permits
- Experience (Reference letters)

**AI Readiness Assessment:**

```
✅ Met: Valid matching document exists
⚠ Needs Update: Document found but outdated
❌ Missing: No document in category
```

**Example Output:**

```
Readiness Score: 82%
✅ CIPC Registration – Valid
✅ B-BBEE Certificate – Level 2 – Valid
⚠ Municipal Account – Expires in 2 months
❌ ENATIS for Category 3 Truck – Missing
```

# Architecture Diagram

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the architecture of Tender Track 360, showcasing the relationships between components and the flow of data through the system.

## Diagram Description

The architecture follows a modern full-stack approach with Next.js as the primary framework, leveraging Supabase for authentication and storage, with Drizzle as the ORM layer.

### Components to include in visualization:

#### Frontend Layer
- **Next.js Application**
  - Client Components (React)
  - Server Components 
  - App Router
- **User Interface**
  - Dashboard Views
  - Tender Management
  - Document Repository
  - User Management
  - Reports & Analytics

#### Backend Layer
- **Next.js Server**
  - Server Actions (API handlers)
  - Authentication Middleware
  - Route Handlers
- **Supabase Integration**
  - Authentication
  - Storage
  - Realtime Subscriptions

#### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL Database** (via Supabase)
  - Drizzle ORM
  - Database Migrations
  - Schema

#### External Services
- **Email Service**
  - User Invitations
  - Notifications
- **File Storage**
  - Document Storage
  - Version Control

### Key Interactions to illustrate:
1. User authentication flow through Supabase
2. Server action requests from client components
3. Data persistence via Drizzle ORM
4. File upload/download processes
5. Email notification processes

## Suggested Layout
The diagram should be organized in layers (Frontend → Backend → Data) with clear arrows showing data flow and dependencies between components.

# Tech Stack

## Overview
Tender Track 360 utilizes a modern, JavaScript-based technology stack optimized for developer productivity, performance, and scalability. This document outlines the key technologies used in the project and the rationale behind each choice.

## Core Technologies

### Frontend Framework: Next.js
- **Version:** 14.x
- **Purpose:** Serves as both the frontend and backend framework
- **Key Features Used:**
  - Server Components for efficient rendering
  - App Router for advanced routing capabilities
  - Server Actions for backend logic
  - Image optimization
  - Automatic code splitting
- **Rationale:** Next.js provides a complete solution for building full-stack applications with React, offering both client and server-side rendering capabilities. The framework's built-in optimizations and developer experience make it ideal for rapid development while maintaining performance.

### UI Library: React
- **Version:** 18.x
- **Purpose:** Component-based user interface development
- **Key Features Used:**
  - Hooks for state management
  - Context API for state sharing
  - Suspense for loading states
- **Rationale:** React is the industry standard for building interactive UIs with its component-based architecture and efficient rendering through the virtual DOM.

### Styling: Tailwind CSS
- **Version:** 3.x
- **Purpose:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Key Features Used:**
  - JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler
  - Custom theme configuration
  - Component classes
- **Rationale:** Tailwind enables rapid UI development with minimal context switching between HTML and CSS files. Its utility-first approach leads to more consistent design and smaller CSS bundle sizes.

### Authentication: Supabase Auth
- **Version:** Latest
- **Purpose:** User authentication and session management
- **Key Features Used:**
  - Email/password authentication
  - JWT tokens
  - Row-Level Security
  - User management
- **Rationale:** Supabase Auth provides a complete authentication solution with easy integration into our tech stack. It offers security best practices out of the box and handles complex authentication flows with minimal setup.

### Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Version:** 15.x
- **Purpose:** Primary data store
- **Key Features Used:**
  - Relational data model
  - JSON support
  - Full-text search
  - Row-level security policies
- **Rationale:** PostgreSQL offers a robust, ACID-compliant database with excellent support for complex queries and relationships, which is ideal for tracking the tender process lifecycle.

### ORM: Drizzle
- **Version:** Latest
- **Purpose:** Type-safe database access layer
- **Key Features Used:**
  - Schema definition
  - Query building
  - Migrations
  - TypeScript integration
- **Rationale:** Drizzle provides a lightweight, type-safe way to interact with our PostgreSQL database. It offers better performance than heavier ORMs while maintaining excellent TypeScript integration and developer experience.

### File Storage: Supabase Storage
- **Version:** Latest
- **Purpose:** Document storage and management
- **Key Features Used:**
  - Bucket management
  - Access controls
  - Public/private files
- **Rationale:** Supabase Storage offers simple integration with our authentication system and provides all the necessary features for managing tender documents securely.

## Development Tools

### Package Manager: npm/pnpm
- **Version:** Latest
- **Purpose:** Dependency management
- **Rationale:** Standard package management for JavaScript projects.

### TypeScript
- **Version:** 5.x
- **Purpose:** Type safety and developer experience
- **Rationale:** TypeScript provides static typing to JavaScript, catching errors during development and improving code quality and maintainability.

### ESLint & Prettier
- **Purpose:** Code quality and formatting
- **Rationale:** Ensures consistent code style across the project and catches common errors.

### Jest & React Testing Library
- **Purpose:** Unit and component testing
- **Rationale:** Industry standard testing tools for React applications.

### Playwright
- **Purpose:** End-to-end testing
- **Rationale:** Comprehensive browser testing with excellent developer experience.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Hosting: Vercel
- **Purpose:** Application hosting and deployment
- **Key Features Used:**
  - Edge functions
  - Preview deployments
  - CI/CD integration
  - Analytics
- **Rationale:** Vercel is optimized for Next.js applications and provides a seamless deployment experience with automatic preview deployments for each pull request.

### Database Hosting: Supabase
- **Purpose:** Managed PostgreSQL database
- **Rationale:** Supabase provides a fully managed PostgreSQL service with additional features like authentication and storage that integrate well with our application.

## Future Considerations

- **Real-time Features:** Potential implementation using Supabase Realtime
- **Advanced Search:** Consideration of dedicated search services (Algolia/Meilisearch) as document volume grows
- **API Caching:** Implementation of Redis for caching as scale demands
- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent environments across development and production
- **Monitoring:** Integration of application performance monitoring tools

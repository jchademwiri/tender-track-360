# Architecture Overview

This section provides comprehensive technical documentation for Tender Track 360's architecture, covering system design, database schema, technology choices, and security considerations.

## 📋 Architecture Documentation

### 🏗️ [System Architecture](./system-architecture.md)

- **High-level Overview** - System components and their interactions
- **Application Layers** - Presentation, business logic, data, and storage layers
- **Service Architecture** - Microservices approach and API design
- **Scalability Considerations** - Performance and growth planning

### 🗄️ [Database Schema](./database-schema.md)

- **Complete Schema** - All tables, relationships, and constraints
- **Entity Relationships** - Visual and textual relationship documentation
- **Indexing Strategy** - Performance optimization through proper indexing
- **Migration Strategy** - Database versioning and deployment approach

### 🛠️ [Technology Stack](./technology-stack.md)

- **Frontend Technologies** - Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Technologies** - Server Actions, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication** - Better Auth implementation and security
- **File Storage** - UploadThing integration and file management
- **Deployment** - Vercel hosting and CI/CD pipeline

### 🔒 [Security Architecture](./security-architecture.md)

- **Authentication & Authorization** - User management and role-based access
- **Data Protection** - Encryption, validation, and secure storage
- **API Security** - Rate limiting, CSRF protection, and input validation
- **File Security** - Upload validation, virus scanning, and access control

### 🔄 [Data Flow](./data-flow.md)

- **User Interactions** - How data flows through the application
- **API Endpoints** - Request/response patterns and data transformation
- **Database Operations** - CRUD operations and transaction management
- **File Operations** - Upload, storage, and retrieval workflows

### 📊 [Performance Architecture](./performance-architecture.md)

- **Caching Strategy** - Application and database caching
- **Database Optimization** - Query optimization and connection pooling
- **Frontend Performance** - Code splitting, lazy loading, and optimization
- **Monitoring** - Performance metrics and health checks

## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Full-Stack Next.js Architecture**

- **Rationale**: Unified development experience with Server Actions
- **Benefits**: Type safety, reduced API surface, simplified deployment
- **Trade-offs**: Vendor lock-in to Vercel ecosystem

### 2. **PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM**

- **Rationale**: Type-safe database operations with excellent PostgreSQL support
- **Benefits**: Full TypeScript integration, migration management, performance
- **Trade-offs**: Learning curve compared to traditional ORMs

### 3. **Better Auth for Authentication**

- **Rationale**: Modern, secure authentication with organization support
- **Benefits**: Built-in security features, role-based access, session management
- **Trade-offs**: Newer library with smaller ecosystem

### 4. **UploadThing for File Storage**

- **Rationale**: Seamless Next.js integration with built-in security
- **Benefits**: CDN delivery, automatic optimization, security scanning
- **Trade-offs**: Vendor dependency, cost considerations at scale

### 5. **Role-Based Multi-Tenancy**

- **Rationale**: Organization-based isolation with role-based permissions
- **Benefits**: Data security, scalable user management, flexible access control
- **Trade-offs**: Increased complexity in data queries and UI logic

## 🔧 Development Principles

### 1. **Type Safety First**

- End-to-end TypeScript implementation
- Database schema types generated automatically
- API contracts enforced through types

### 2. **Security by Design**

- Role-based access control at every layer
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file handling and storage

### 3. **Performance Optimization**

- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Frontend code splitting and lazy loading
- Caching at multiple levels

### 4. **Maintainable Code Structure**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

### 5. **Scalable Architecture**

- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Database optimization for growth
- CDN integration for global performance

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

```
Local Machine
├── Next.js Dev Server (localhost:3000)
├── PostgreSQL Database (localhost:5432)
├── UploadThing (Development Keys)
└── Better Auth (Local Configuration)
```

### Production Environment

```
Vercel Platform
├── Next.js Application (Global CDN)
├── Neon PostgreSQL (Managed Database)
├── UploadThing (Production Storage)
└── Better Auth (Production Configuration)
```

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Current Capacity

- **Users**: 100+ concurrent users
- **Tenders**: 10,000+ active tenders
- **Files**: 100GB+ storage capacity
- **Database**: 10GB+ data storage

### Scaling Strategies

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple Vercel instances
- **Database Scaling**: Neon read replicas and connection pooling
- **File Storage**: UploadThing CDN and regional distribution
- **Caching**: Redis integration for session and query caching

## 🔍 Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring

- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **User Analytics**: Feature usage, user journeys, conversion rates
- **System Health**: Database connections, file storage, authentication

### Error Tracking

- **Frontend Errors**: JavaScript errors, network failures, UI issues
- **Backend Errors**: Server errors, database failures, authentication issues
- **File Operations**: Upload failures, storage issues, access problems

# Business Extension Tables - Requirements

## Introduction

The Business Extension Tables feature extends the Better Auth authentication system with business-specific user data for Tender Track 360. This includes user profiles that bridge authentication with business roles and permissions, and user preferences for application customization and notification settings.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user profile is created THEN the system SHALL associate it with the user's organization and set appropriate business permissions
3. WHEN displaying user information THEN the system SHALL show both Better Auth data (name, email) and business profile data (role, department, status)
4. WHEN a user's business role changes THEN the system SHALL update permissions immediately and log the change
5. WHEN a user is soft-deleted THEN the system SHALL maintain profile data for audit purposes while marking as inactive

### Requirement 2 (Business Role Management)

5. WHEN displaying role information THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between Better Auth roles and business roles

### Requirement 3 (User Profile Data Management)

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile to include business-relevant information, so that the system can provide appropriate context and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my profile THEN the system SHALL display my department, business role, last login, and onboarding status

3. WHEN tracking user activity THEN the system SHALL record last login time and onboarding completion status
4. WHEN managing user lifecycle THEN the system SHALL support soft deletion with audit trail preservation
5. WHEN querying user data THEN the system SHALL efficiently filter by organization, role, and active status

### Requirement 4 (User Preferences System)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my application experience through preferences, so that the system works according to my workflow and communication needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up my account THEN the system SHALL create default preferences based on organization settings
2. WHEN configuring notifications THEN the system SHALL allow granular control over email and push notifications by type
3. WHEN setting regional preferences THEN the system SHALL support timezone, language, date format, and time format customization
4. WHEN updating preferences THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately across the application
5. WHEN preferences conflict with organization policies THEN the system SHALL enforce organization-level restrictions

### Requirement 5 (Notification Preferences Management)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control what notifications I receive and how, so that I can stay informed without being overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing notification settings THEN the system SHALL provide separate controls for deadline reminders, status changes, task assignments, document updates, extension requests, and system alerts
2. WHEN setting reminder preferences THEN the system SHALL allow customization of reminder timing (default 7 days before deadlines)
3. WHEN receiving notifications THEN the system SHALL respect both user preferences and organization-mandated notifications
4. WHEN notification preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to future notifications
5. WHEN organization policies change THEN the system SHALL override user preferences where required by policy

### Requirement 6 (Multi-Organization Profile Support)

**User Story:** As a user who belongs to multiple organizations, I want separate business contexts per organization, so that my role and preferences can be appropriate for each organization's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN switching between organizations THEN the system SHALL apply the appropriate business role and permissions
3. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL allow both global preferences and organization-specific overrides

### Requirement 8 (Performance and Scalability)

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want efficient database design for user profiles and preferences, so that the system performs well as the user base grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying user profiles THEN the system SHALL use optimized indexes for organization, role, and status lookups
2. WHEN loading user data THEN the system SHALL efficiently join Better Auth tables with business extension tables
3. WHEN filtering users THEN the system SHALL support pagination and efficient filtering by multiple criteria
4. WHEN the system scales THEN the database design SHALL support thousands of users per organization without performance degradation
5. WHEN accessing preferences THEN the system SHALL cache frequently accessed preference data to minimize database queries

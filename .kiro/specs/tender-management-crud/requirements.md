# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the tender management system using Next.js Server Actions. The system will provide full lifecycle management for tenders, from initial creation through follow-ups, projects, and client relationships. Each implementation phase must be production-ready upon completion, allowing users to immediately benefit from the functionality while building toward the complete system.

The implementation will follow a phased approach where each phase delivers complete, usable functionality for specific aspects of tender management, ensuring continuous value delivery and allowing for early user feedback and testing. All data operations will be handled through server actions for optimal performance and type safety.

## Requirements

2. WHEN I create client table THEN the system SHALL include embedded contact fields (contactName, contactEmail, contactPhone) with organization isolation
3. WHEN I create tender table THEN the system SHALL include tenderNumber as unique identifier with client foreign key relationship
4. WHEN I create project table THEN the system SHALL include projectNumber and description fields with optional tender inheritance logic
5. WHEN I create purchaseOrder table THEN the system SHALL include supplier name defaulting logic and project relationship
6. WHEN I create followUp table THEN the system SHALL include tender relationship and user attribution fields
7. WHEN migrations complete THEN all existing tables SHALL remain unchanged and functional

### Requirement 2: Client Management Foundation (MVP Phase 2)

**User Story:** As a tender manager, I want to manage essential client information efficiently, so that I can maintain client relationships and use this data across all tender activities.

5. WHEN I add contact information THEN the system SHALL store contact name, email, and phone as part of the client record
6. WHEN I search for clients THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search across client name and contact information
7. WHEN I view a client THEN the system SHALL display client information, contact details, and all associated tenders in organized sections

### Requirement 3: Core Tender Management (MVP Phase 3)

**User Story:** As a tender manager, I want to create and manage tenders with unique tender numbers and lifecycle tracking, so that I can monitor all tender activities from submission to completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new tender THEN the system SHALL require user to input a unique tender number, require client selection, and allow optional description
2. WHEN I set tender details THEN the system SHALL allow optional submission date, value, and status selection from predefined options (draft, submitted, won, lost, pending)
3. WHEN I update tender status THEN the system SHALL track status changes with timestamps and user information using server actions
4. WHEN I view tenders THEN the system SHALL display them in a sortable, filterable table with tender number as primary identifier
5. WHEN I search tenders THEN the system SHALL provide search across tender number, client name, and description using server actions
6. WHEN I delete a tender THEN the system SHALL perform soft deletion using server actions and require confirmation
7. WHEN I view tender details THEN the system SHALL show complete information including related follow-ups and projects
8. WHEN I reference a tender THEN the system SHALL use the user-input tender number as the primary identifier and validate uniqueness

### Requirement 4: Follow-up Management (MVP Phase 4)

**User Story:** As a tender manager, I want to track follow-up activities for each tender, so that I can maintain communication records and schedule future actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a follow-up THEN the system SHALL require tender selection and allow notes and contact person information
2. WHEN I add follow-up details THEN the system SHALL allow optional next follow-up date and contact person details
3. WHEN I view follow-ups THEN the system SHALL display them chronologically for each tender
4. WHEN I add follow-up notes THEN the system SHALL timestamp entries and associate with the logged-in user using server actions
5. WHEN I update follow-ups THEN the system SHALL save changes immediately using server actions
6. WHEN I delete a follow-up THEN the system SHALL perform soft deletion using server actions
7. WHEN I search follow-ups THEN the system SHALL provide search across tender number and notes using server actions
8. WHEN I complete a follow-up THEN the system SHALL allow creation of subsequent follow-ups

### Requirement 5: Project Management (MVP Phase 5)

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to convert won tenders into projects with inherited information, so that I can track project execution and link to procurement activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I convert a won tender to project THEN the system SHALL create project with project number inherited from tender number
2. WHEN I create a project from tender THEN the system SHALL inherit project description from tender description
3. WHEN I create a standalone project THEN the system SHALL require project number and description using server actions
4. WHEN I update project information THEN the system SHALL save changes immediately using server actions
5. WHEN I view projects THEN the system SHALL display them with project number as primary identifier
6. WHEN I search projects THEN the system SHALL provide search across project number and description using server actions
7. WHEN I delete a project THEN the system SHALL perform soft deletion using server actions and prevent deletion if purchase orders exist
8. WHEN I view project details THEN the system SHALL show linked tender information and associated purchase orders

### Requirement 6: Purchase Order Management (MVP Phase 6)

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create and manage purchase orders for projects with supplier management, so that I can track project procurement and costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a purchase order THEN the system SHALL require project selection and default supplier name to organization name
2. WHEN I set supplier information THEN the system SHALL allow me to override default with custom supplier name for outsourcing
3. WHEN I add purchase order details THEN the system SHALL require description and total amount using server actions
4. WHEN I update purchase order status THEN the system SHALL track changes between draft, sent, and delivered states using server actions

6. WHEN I search purchase orders THEN the system SHALL provide search across project number, supplier name, and description using server actions
7. WHEN I delete a purchase order THEN the system SHALL perform soft deletion using server actions and require confirmation
8. WHEN I view purchase order details THEN the system SHALL show linked project information and supplier details

# Design Document

## Overview

The tender management CRUD system will be implemented as a comprehensive web application with a modern, responsive interface built on Next.js with TypeScript. The system follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers. Each phase will be production-ready upon completion, allowing immediate deployment and user adoption.

The implementation strategy prioritizes foundational components first (client management), then builds core tender functionality, and finally adds advanced features like analytics and integrations. This approach ensures users can begin benefiting from the system immediately while we continue development.

}

// Tender Management (MVP)
interface TenderCreateInput {
  tenderNumber: string; // User-input unique identifier (validated for uniqueness)
  description?: string;
  clientId: string;
  submissionDate?: Date;
  value?: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'submitted' | 'won' | 'lost' | 'pending';
}

}
```

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Management Strategy

```typescript
// Error Types
interface APIError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details?: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Error Categories
enum ErrorCodes {
  VALIDATION_ERROR = 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
  NOT_FOUND = 'NOT_FOUND',
  UNAUTHORIZED = 'UNAUTHORIZED',
  CONFLICT = 'CONFLICT',
  INTERNAL_ERROR = 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
  RATE_LIMIT = 'RATE_LIMIT',
}

// Error Handling Middleware
const errorHandler = (error: Error, req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Log error for monitoring
  // Return user-friendly error response
  // Maintain security by not exposing internal details
};
```

### User Experience Error Handling

- Form validation with real-time feedback

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature expands the existing database schema to support missing functionality identified in the dashboard navigation. The current schema lacks tables for project management, client management, calendar functionality, user preferences, and notification systems. This expansion will add 12 new tables to support the complete dashboard feature set while maintaining consistency with the existing multi-tenant architecture and security patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive project management tables, so that users can manage projects separately from tenders and track purchase orders with detailed line items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL store project details with organization isolation
2. WHEN a purchase order is created THEN the system SHALL link it to a project and support multiple line items
3. WHEN purchase order items are added THEN the system SHALL track quantities, prices, and descriptions
4. IF a project is soft deleted THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity with purchase orders
5. WHEN projects are queried THEN the system SHALL support filtering by organization and status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want dedicated client management functionality, so that I can maintain detailed client information beyond just names in tender records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client is created THEN the system SHALL store comprehensive client details with organization isolation
2. WHEN client contacts are added THEN the system SHALL support multiple contacts per client
3. WHEN client addresses are managed THEN the system SHALL support multiple addresses per client
4. IF a client is referenced in tenders THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
5. WHEN clients are soft deleted THEN the system SHALL preserve historical tender relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want calendar and reminder functionality, so that I can schedule events and receive notifications for important dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar events are created THEN the system SHALL support organization-wide and user-specific events
2. WHEN reminders are set THEN the system SHALL link them to tenders, projects, or standalone events
3. WHEN reminder dates arrive THEN the system SHALL support notification triggering
4. IF events are recurring THEN the system SHALL handle recurring patterns
5. WHEN events are deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up associated reminders

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want personalized settings and notification preferences, so that I can customize my experience and control how I receive notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user preferences are set THEN the system SHALL store personal settings per user
2. WHEN notification preferences are configured THEN the system SHALL respect user choices for different notification types
3. WHEN notifications are generated THEN the system SHALL create notification records for users
4. IF notification preferences change THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future notifications
5. WHEN users access notifications THEN the system SHALL support read/unread status tracking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want analytics data tracking, so that I can view business metrics and performance indicators on my dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL store analytics data with proper organization isolation
2. WHEN dashboard displays metrics THEN the system SHALL retrieve pre-calculated analytics for fast loading
3. WHEN analytics data is requested THEN the system SHALL support different metric types and time periods
4. IF metrics need historical tracking THEN the system SHALL store time-series data with dimensions
5. WHEN analytics queries are performed THEN the system SHALL optimize for dashboard performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all new tables to follow existing patterns, so that the database maintains consistency in security, soft deletion, and multi-tenancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new tables are created THEN the system SHALL implement organization-based isolation where applicable
2. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL include appropriate soft deletion fields
3. WHEN foreign keys are defined THEN the system SHALL use proper cascade deletion rules
4. IF audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL include created/updated timestamp fields
5. WHEN table relationships are established THEN the system SHALL define proper Drizzle relations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want proper indexing and performance considerations, so that the expanded schema maintains good query performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN foreign key relationships are created THEN the system SHALL ensure proper indexing
2. WHEN frequently queried fields are identified THEN the system SHALL consider index requirements
3. WHEN text fields store JSON data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate data types
4. IF tables will have high volume THEN the system SHALL consider partitioning strategies
5. WHEN queries span multiple tables THEN the system SHALL optimize join performance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and relations, so that the new tables integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tables are defined THEN the system SHALL generate proper TypeScript inference types
2. WHEN relations are created THEN the system SHALL define bidirectional relationships where appropriate
3. WHEN enums are needed THEN the system SHALL use pgEnum for type safety
4. IF complex types are required THEN the system SHALL provide proper type definitions
5. WHEN schema is exported THEN the system SHALL include all new tables in the schema object

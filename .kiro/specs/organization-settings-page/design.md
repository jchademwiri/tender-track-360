# Design Document

## Overview

The organization settings page will provide a comprehensive interface for managing all aspects of an organization. The design follows modern web application patterns with a sidebar navigation for different settings sections, responsive layout, and role-based access control. The page will be accessible at `/organization/${organization.slug}/settings` and will integrate seamlessly with the existing application architecture.

## Architecture

### Route Structure

```
/organization/[slug]/settings/

    └── page.tsx (Danger zone - transfer/delete)
```

### Component Hierarchy

### Layout Strategy

- **Sidebar navigation**: Fixed sidebar with settings sections
- **Main content area**: Scrollable content with section-specific forms
- **Responsive design**: Collapsible sidebar on mobile, full-width on tablet/desktop
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show relevant sections based on user permissions

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. OrganizationSettingsLayout

```typescript
interface OrganizationSettingsLayoutProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  organization: Organization;
  userRole: Role;
  memberCount: number;
}
```

**Features:**

- Server component that fetches organization data
- Handles role-based access control
- Provides layout structure with sidebar and main content

### 2. OrganizationSettingsHeader

```typescript
interface OrganizationSettingsHeaderProps {

- Mobile menu toggle

### 3. OrganizationSettingsSidebar

```typescript
interface OrganizationSettingsSidebarProps {
  organization: Organization;
  userRole: Role;

  defaultMemberRole: Role;
  emailNotifications: {
    newMembers: boolean;
    projectUpdates: boolean;
    weeklyDigest: boolean;
  };
  integrations: {
    slack: boolean;

    webhooks: string[];
  };
}
```

### 7. SecuritySettings

```typescript
interface SecuritySettingsProps {
  organization: Organization;
  securitySettings: SecuritySettings;
  auditLogs: AuditLog[];
}

interface SecuritySettings {
  requireTwoFactor: boolean;
  sessionTimeout: number; // minutes
  allowedDomains: string[];
  ipWhitelist: string[];
}

interface AuditLog {
  id: string;
  action: string;
  userId: string;
  userEmail: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  ipAddress: string;
  details: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### 8. BillingSettings

```typescript
interface BillingSettingsProps {
  organization: Organization;
  subscription: Subscription;
  paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[];
  invoices: Invoice[];
}

interface Subscription {
  plan: 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
  status: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'past_due';
  currentPeriodEnd: Date;
  cancelAtPeriodEnd: boolean;
}
```

### 9. DangerZone

```typescript
interface DangerZoneProps {
  organization: Organization;
  eligibleOwners: User[];
}

interface TransferOwnershipData {
  newOwnerId: string;
  confirmationText: string;
}
```

## Data Models

### Extended Organization Schema

```typescript
interface OrganizationSettings extends Organization {
  description?: string;
  visibility: 'public' | 'private';
  preferences: OrganizationPreferences;
  securitySettings: SecuritySettings;
  subscription?: Subscription;
}
```

### Activity Tracking

```typescript
interface SettingsActivity {
  id: string;
  organizationId: string;
  userId: string;
  action:
    | 'settings_updated'
    | 'member_added'
    | 'member_removed'
    | 'role_changed';
  section: string;
  changes: Record<string, { from: any; to: any }>;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Form Validation

- Real-time validation for all form fields
- Server-side validation with detailed error messages
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Duplicate slug/email checking

### Permission Errors

- Clear messaging when users lack permissions
- Graceful degradation to read-only mode
- Redirect to appropriate sections based on role

### Network Errors

- Retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Offline state handling
- Progress indicators for long operations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Form validation logic
- Permission checking functions
- Data transformation utilities
- Component rendering with different roles

### Integration Tests

- Settings update workflows
- Member management flows
- Role-based access control
- Form submission and validation

### E2E Tests

- Complete settings management workflows
- Multi-user scenarios (owner/admin/member)
- Responsive behavior testing
- Accessibility compliance

## Implementation Details

### Styling Approach

- Consistent with existing design system
- Tailwind CSS with custom components
- Form styling with proper validation states
- Loading and success animations

### State Management

- Server components for initial data loading
- Client components for interactive forms
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Form state management with react-hook-form

### Security Considerations

- Role-based access control at component level
- Server-side permission validation
- Secure file upload for organization logos
- Audit logging for sensitive actions

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading for heavy sections (billing, audit logs)
- Debounced form validation
- Image optimization for logo uploads
- Efficient re-rendering with proper memoization

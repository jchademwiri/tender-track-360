# Email Verification Database Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

The email verification system in Tender Track 360 is not properly saving verification tokens to the database, preventing users from completing the email verification process. This feature will fix the Better Auth configuration to ensure verification tokens are correctly stored and processed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 (Better Auth Configuration Fix)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Better Auth configuration to be properly set up, so that email verification tokens are correctly saved to the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Better Auth is configured THEN the system SHALL use the correct database adapter with proper schema mapping
2. WHEN email verification is enabled THEN the system SHALL properly integrate with the verification table
3. WHEN the organization plugin is needed THEN the system SHALL include it in the configuration
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL log verification token creation and retrieval

### Requirement 2 (Middleware Enhancement)

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication middleware to properly handle email verification status, so that I am redirected appropriately based on my verification state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN middleware processes a request THEN the system SHALL use Better Auth's recommended session validation methods
2. WHEN a user is unverified THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the email verification page
3. WHEN a user is verified THEN the system SHALL allow access to protected routes
4. WHEN session validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error logging

### Requirement 3 (Database Schema Validation)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the database schema matches Better Auth requirements, so that all authentication operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the verification table is queried THEN the system SHALL have all required columns with correct data types
2. WHEN verification tokens are created THEN the system SHALL store them with proper expiration times
3. WHEN the database is migrated THEN the system SHALL include all Better Auth required tables
4. WHEN schema validation runs THEN the system SHALL report any missing or incorrect table structures

### Requirement 4 (Email Verification Flow Testing)

**User Story:** As a user, I want the email verification process to work end-to-end, so that I can successfully verify my email and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL create a verification token in the database
2. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN the system SHALL include a valid token that exists in the database
3. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL find and validate the token from the database
4. WHEN verification is successful THEN the system SHALL mark the user as verified and remove the used token
5. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 5 (Debugging and Monitoring)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging for the email verification process, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification tokens are created THEN the system SHALL log the token creation with user ID and expiration
2. WHEN verification attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with success/failure status
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN email sending occurs THEN the system SHALL log the email delivery status
5. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL log cleanup operations

# Email Verification Database Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

The email verification system in Tender Track 360 is not properly saving verification tokens to the database, preventing users from completing the email verification process. The issue appears to be with the Drizzle adapter schema configuration in Better Auth, where the verification table is not being properly recognized for database operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 (Drizzle Adapter Schema Configuration Fix)

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Better Auth Drizzle adapter to properly recognize the verification table, so that email verification tokens are correctly saved to the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Better Auth is configured THEN the system SHALL use explicit schema mapping for the verification table
2. WHEN email verification tokens are created THEN the system SHALL successfully save them to the verification table
3. WHEN verification tokens are queried THEN the system SHALL successfully retrieve them from the database
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL log verification token creation and retrieval for debugging

### Requirement 2 (Database Operation Logging and Debugging)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging for verification token operations, so that I can debug and confirm tokens are being saved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification tokens are created THEN the system SHALL log the token creation with user identifier and expiration
2. WHEN verification tokens are queried THEN the system SHALL log the database query results
3. WHEN verification operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN email verification is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the token validation process

### Requirement 3 (Email Verification Flow Validation)

**User Story:** As a user, I want the email verification process to work end-to-end, so that I can successfully verify my email and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL create a verification token in the database
2. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN the system SHALL include a valid token that exists in the database
3. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL find and validate the token from the database
4. WHEN verification is successful THEN the system SHALL mark the user as verified and remove the used token
5. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 4 (Database Connection and Query Testing)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the database connection and verification table operations work correctly, so that I can confirm the fix is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing database connectivity THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to the verification table
2. WHEN inserting test verification tokens THEN the system SHALL successfully save them to the database
3. WHEN querying verification tokens THEN the system SHALL successfully retrieve them with all fields
4. WHEN deleting verification tokens THEN the system SHALL successfully remove them from the database
5. WHEN running database tests THEN the system SHALL report success or failure with detailed information

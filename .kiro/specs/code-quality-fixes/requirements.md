# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the build failures and code quality issues preventing successful production builds. The application currently fails to build due to ESLint errors including unescaped characters, unused variables, and other linting violations. This spec focuses on systematically resolving these issues to ensure clean, maintainable code and successful builds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully without ESLint errors, so that I can deploy to production and maintain code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without any ESLint errors
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL not report any critical linting violations that prevent builds
3. WHEN unescaped characters are found in JSX THEN the system SHALL use proper HTML entities (&quot;, &apos;)
4. WHEN variables are declared but unused THEN the system SHALL either remove them or mark them appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused imports and variables to be cleaned up, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are not used in a file THEN the system SHALL remove the unused imports
2. WHEN variables are declared but never used THEN the system SHALL remove the unused variables
3. WHEN function parameters are not used THEN the system SHALL prefix them with underscore or remove them appropriately
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper HTML entity encoding in JSX components, so that the application renders correctly and follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quotation marks appear in JSX text THEN the system SHALL use &quot; instead of raw quotes
2. WHEN apostrophes appear in JSX text THEN the system SHALL use &apos; instead of raw apostrophes
3. WHEN HTML entities are used THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual output for users
4. WHEN special characters are encoded THEN the system SHALL prevent potential XSS vulnerabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want const declarations for variables that are never reassigned, so that the code follows JavaScript best practices and prevents accidental mutations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is declared with let but never reassigned THEN the system SHALL use const instead
2. WHEN const is used appropriately THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality
3. WHEN variable declarations are updated THEN the system SHALL not break any existing logic
4. WHEN the changes are complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Next.js specific optimizations to be properly implemented, so that the application follows framework best practices and performs optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN img tags are used THEN the system SHALL suggest or implement Next.js Image component where appropriate
2. WHEN Image optimization warnings appear THEN the system SHALL address them according to Next.js best practices
3. WHEN framework-specific linting rules are violated THEN the system SHALL fix them while maintaining functionality
4. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL improve performance metrics where possible

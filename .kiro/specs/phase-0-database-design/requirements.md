# Phase 0: Database Design - Foundation Schema Requirements

## Introduction

The Database Design phase establishes the foundational data architecture for Tender Track 360, integrating Better Auth for authentication with organization-based multi-tenancy, and creating optimized schemas for tender management with proper relationships and constraints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 (Authentication & Organizations)

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to integrate Better Auth with organization-based multi-tenancy, so that users are properly isolated by organization while maintaining secure authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Better Auth is configured THEN the system SHALL auto-generate user authentication tables with Drizzle integration
2. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL create an organization and assign the user as admin
3. WHEN users are created THEN they SHALL be associated with an organization and assigned appropriate roles
4. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL enforce organization-level data isolation

### Requirement 2 (Core Tender Schema)

**User Story:** As a database designer, I want to create an optimized tender schema, so that tender data is efficiently stored with proper relationships and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing tender table THEN the system SHALL include essential fields (reference, title, status, dates, values, organization)
2. WHEN creating relationships THEN the system SHALL properly link tenders to clients, categories, and users
3. WHEN enforcing constraints THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate reference numbers within organizations
4. WHEN indexing data THEN the system SHALL optimize queries for common search patterns

### Requirement 3 (Audit Trail & Change Tracking)

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails, so that all changes to tender data are tracked for accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users modify data THEN the system SHALL log all changes with user attribution and timestamps
2. WHEN tracking status changes THEN the system SHALL record status transitions with validation
3. WHEN auditing activities THEN the system SHALL provide complete change history per tender
4. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL show who made what changes and when

### Requirement 4 (Document Management Schema)

**User Story:** As a file management architect, I want to design document storage schema, so that files are organized efficiently with UploadThing integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing documents THEN the system SHALL reference UploadThing URLs with proper metadata
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL support organization/tender/category folder structure
3. WHEN versioning documents THEN the system SHALL track document versions and relationships
4. WHEN managing access THEN the system SHALL integrate document permissions with user roles

### Requirement 5 (Performance & Scalability)

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized database design, so that the system performs well as data grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating indexes THEN the system SHALL optimize for common query patterns
2. WHEN designing relationships THEN the system SHALL use efficient foreign key structures
3. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL support pagination and filtering
4. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with proper database design

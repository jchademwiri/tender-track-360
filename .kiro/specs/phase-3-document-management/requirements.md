# Phase 3: File Management - Document Repository Requirements

## Introduction

The Document Repository feature provides enhanced file management capabilities for tender-related documents. This phase builds on the basic file upload from Phase 1 to add organization, categorization, version control, and permission management using UploadThing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 (Enhanced File Organization)

**User Story:** As a tender officer, I want to organize tender documents by category and type, so that files are easy to find and manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL allow categorization by type (tender_notice, technical_specs, financial_proposal, legal_docs, correspondence)
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL use folder structure: /org-name/tender-id/category/filename
3. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL display files grouped by category
4. WHEN searching files THEN users SHALL be able to filter by category, file type, and upload date

### Requirement 2 (Basic Version Control)

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to track document versions, so that I can see changes and access previous versions when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a file with existing name THEN the system SHALL create a new version while preserving the original
2. WHEN viewing document history THEN the system SHALL display all versions with timestamps and uploading user
3. WHEN downloading documents THEN users SHALL be able to access both current and previous versions
4. WHEN managing versions THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the latest version

### Requirement 3 (Document Permissions)

**User Story:** As a tender manager, I want to control who can access sensitive documents, so that confidential information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting document permissions THEN the system SHALL allow restriction by user role and tender assignment
2. WHEN accessing documents THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions before allowing download
3. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL update access immediately
4. WHEN viewing document lists THEN users SHALL only see documents they have permission to access

### Requirement 4 (Document Search and Management)

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to quickly find specific documents, so that I can access needed files efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching documents THEN the system SHALL search across file names, categories, and descriptions
2. WHEN filtering documents THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by tender, category, file type, and date ranges
3. WHEN managing documents THEN users SHALL be able to rename, move, and delete files (with appropriate permissions)
4. WHEN viewing large document lists THEN the system SHALL provide pagination and sorting options

### Requirement 5 (Document Scanning and Submission)

**User Story:** As a tender officer, I want to scan and organize documents before tender submission, so that all required documents are properly prepared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for submission THEN the system SHALL provide a document checklist based on tender requirements
2. WHEN scanning documents THEN the system SHALL allow bulk upload with automatic categorization suggestions
3. WHEN reviewing for submission THEN the system SHALL highlight missing or incomplete document categories
4. WHEN submitting tenders THEN the system SHALL create a submission package with all required documents

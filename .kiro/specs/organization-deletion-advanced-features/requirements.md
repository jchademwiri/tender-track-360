6. WHEN bulk operations complete THEN the system SHALL log all changes in the audit trail with individual member details
7. IF bulk operations involve large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable performance through batching and background processing

### Requirement 4: Advanced Security Features

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL provide organization data in multiple formats including JSON and CSV
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all related information including members, tenders, contracts, and audit logs
3. WHEN data import is performed THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and process imports safely
4. WHEN backup operations are initiated THEN the system SHALL create complete organization backups with restore capabilities
5. WHEN data retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce automatic data lifecycle management

### Requirement 6: User Experience and Safety

**User Story:** As any organization user, I want clear feedback and safety measures for all operations so that I understand what's happening and can avoid mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing any operation THEN the system SHALL provide clear, real-time feedback on operation status

# Settings Enhancement Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for the Settings Enhancement project, broken down into 5 independent phases. Each phase is designed to be self-contained and deployable, ensuring the system remains functional throughout development.

## Project Overview

The Settings Enhancement project transforms the current basic settings interface into a comprehensive organization management system with role-based access control, member management, and advanced features.

## Phase Structure

Each phase is designed to:

- ✅ **Be independently deployable** - System works with no errors after each phase
- ✅ **Build incrementally** - Each phase adds value without breaking existing functionality
- ✅ **Include comprehensive testing** - Unit, integration, and manual testing requirements
- ✅ **Have clear acceptance criteria** - Measurable success metrics
- ✅ **Address specific problems** - Focused scope with clear goals

## Phases Overview

### [Phase 1: Simplify Main Settings Page & Fix Navigation](./settings-enhancement-phase-1.md)

**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Goal**: Create a clean, focused main settings page with working navigation

**Key Deliverables**:

- Simplified main settings interface
- Working navigation between all settings pages
- Fixed button type attributes (resolve linting issues)
- Responsive design improvements

**Success Criteria**: Clean main settings page with working navigation, no build/dev errors

### [Phase 2: Multi-Organization View with Role-Based Access](./settings-enhancement-phase-2.md)

**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Goal**: Display all user organizations with proper role-based access control

**Key Deliverables**:

- Multi-organization display using existing `getorganizations()`
- Role-based UI (read-only for members, full access for owners/admins/managers)
- Organization selection interface with statistics
- Integration with existing permission system

**Success Criteria**: Multi-organization view with role-based access, no build/dev errors

---

### [Phase 3: Organization Management Interface](./settings-enhancement-phase-3.md)

**Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Goal**: Full organization management with member management and tabbed interface

**Key Deliverables**:

- Tabbed management interface (General, Members, Invitations, Settings, Security)
- Integration with existing invitation system
- Member management with role changes and removal
- Organization details editing with proper validation

**Success Criteria**: Complete organization management with member management, no build/dev errors

---

### [Phase 4: Organization Deletion & Advanced Features](./settings-enhancement-phase-4.md)

**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Goal**: Safe organization deletion and advanced management features

**Key Deliverables**:

- Safe organization deletion with multiple safeguards
- Ownership transfer functionality
- Bulk operations for efficient management
- Advanced security features and audit logging
- Data export capabilities

**Success Criteria**: Complete organization management system with deletion and advanced features, no build/dev errors

---

### [Phase 5: Polish & Production Readiness](./settings-enhancement-phase-5.md)

**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Goal**: Final polish, testing, and production optimization

**Key Deliverables**:

- UI/UX consistency and polish
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
- Complete documentation
- Production deployment readiness

**Success Criteria**: Production-ready settings system with comprehensive organization management

## Technical Architecture

### Leveraging Existing Systems

The implementation leverages existing robust systems:

- **Organization System**: `src/server/organizations.ts` with `getorganizations()` and `OrganizationWithStats`
- **Invitation System**: `src/server/invitations.ts` with full CRUD operations
- **Permission System**: `src/lib/auth/permissions.ts` with owner/admin/manager/member roles
- **Authentication**: Existing Better Auth implementation
- **UI Components**: Current design system and component library

### Role-Based Access Control

```typescript
// Permission hierarchy
Owner > Admin > Manager > Member;

// Permission logic
const canManage = ['owner', 'admin', 'manager'].includes(userRole);
const canDelete = userRole === 'owner';
const canInviteMembers = ['owner', 'admin', 'manager'].includes(userRole);
const isReadOnly = userRole === 'member';
```

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication** → Current user and session
2. **Organization Fetch** → `getorganizations()` with role information
3. **Permission Check** → Role-based UI rendering
4. **Operations** → Server actions with permission validation
5. **Updates** → Real-time UI updates and error handling

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper loading states
- Responsive design
- Accessibility compliance

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all components and utilities
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Manual testing across all user roles
- Performance testing with realistic data
- Security testing for permission systems

### Documentation Standards

- Clear acceptance criteria for each feature
- API documentation for new endpoints
- User guides for complex features
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Getting Started

1. **Review Phase 1 Spec** - Start with the foundation
2. **Set up development environment** - Ensure all dependencies are available
3. **Run existing tests** - Verify current system works
4. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** - Follow the detailed specification
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure no regressions before moving to next phase

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Zero build or development errors after each phase
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- API response times under 500ms
- Test coverage above 90%
- No critical security vulnerabilities

### User Experience Metrics

- Intuitive navigation between settings sections
- Clear role-based access control
- Efficient organization and member management
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Mobile-responsive design

### Business Metrics

- Reduced support tickets for settings-related issues
- Increased user engagement with organization features
- Improved onboarding experience for new organizations
- Enhanced security through proper role management

## Support and Resources

- **Existing Codebase**: Review `src/server/organizations.ts` and `src/server/invitations.ts`
- **Permission System**: Study `src/lib/auth/permissions.ts`
- **UI Components**: Use existing design system components
- **Testing Examples**: Follow patterns in existing test files
- **Documentation**: Refer to existing API and user documentation

Each specification includes detailed implementation guidance, testing requirements, and success criteria to ensure successful delivery of each phase.

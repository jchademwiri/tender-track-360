## User Stories

**As an organization owner, I want to manage all aspects of my organization** so that I can maintain control and ensure proper configuration.

**As an organization admin, I want to manage members and settings** so that I can help maintain the organization effectively.

**As an organization manager, I want to invite and manage team members** so that I can build and maintain my team.

**As any organization member, I want to see organization information** so that I can stay informed about my organization.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create/Modify

- `src/app/dashboard/settings/organisation/[organizationId]/page.tsx` - Main management page
- `src/app/dashboard/settings/organisation/[organizationId]/components/` - Tab components
- `src/server/organizations-actions.ts` - New server actions for organization management

### Components to Create

- `OrganizationManagementTabs` - Main tabbed interface
- `GeneralTab` - Organization details management
- `MembersTab` - Member management interface
- `InvitationsTab` - Invitation management interface
- `SettingsTab` - Organization settings
- `SecurityTab` - Security settings (owner/admin only)
- `MemberList` - Member display and management

### Server Actions to Create

```typescript
// Organization management actions
updateOrganizationDetails(organizationId: string, data: OrganizationUpdateData)
updateMemberRole(organizationId: string, memberId: string, newRole: Role)
removeMember(organizationId: string, memberId: string)
updateOrganizationSettings(organizationId: string, settings: OrganizationSettings)
```

### Integration with Existing Functions

# Tender Page Organization Switching Fix

## Problem

When switching organizations on the main tenders page (`/dashboard/tenders`), the stats cards would update correctly, but the **TenderList component** would not refresh to show the new organization's tenders. The same issue existed for the clients page.

## Root Cause

The `TenderList` and `ClientList` components were missing the `useEffect` hooks that watch for `organizationId` prop changes. When you switch organizations:

1. ✅ Server component gets new `session.activeOrganizationId`
2. ✅ Stats cards update (they're rendered server-side)
3. ❌ List components don't refetch data for the new organization

## Solution Applied

### TenderList (`src/components/tenders/tender-list.tsx`)

```typescript
// Added missing imports
import { useState, useTransition, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

// Wrapped fetchTenders in useCallback for stable reference
const fetchTenders = useCallback(
  async (search?: string, page: number = 1) => {
    // ... existing logic
  },
  [organizationId]
);

// Added useEffect to react to organizationId changes
useEffect(() => {
  // Reset search and filters
  setSearchQuery('');
  setStatusFilter('all');
  setCurrentPage(1);

  // Fetch fresh data for the new organization
  if (organizationId) {
    fetchTenders('', 1);
  }
}, [organizationId, fetchTenders]);
```

### ClientList (`src/components/clients/client-list.tsx`)

```typescript
// Added missing imports
import { useState, useTransition, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

// Wrapped fetchClients in useCallback for stable reference
const fetchClients = useCallback(
  async (search?: string, page: number = 1) => {
    // ... existing logic
  },
  [organizationId]
);

// Added useEffect to react to organizationId changes
useEffect(() => {
  // Reset search and filters
  setSearchQuery('');
  setCurrentPage(1);

  // Fetch fresh data for the new organization
  if (organizationId) {
    fetchClients('', 1);
  }
}, [organizationId, fetchClients]);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User switches organization** using team switcher
2. **Session refresh** happens (from our previous organization switching fix)
3. **Server component re-renders** with new `session.activeOrganizationId`
4. **Stats cards update** (server-rendered) ✅
5. **List components receive new `organizationId` prop** ✅
6. **`useEffect` triggers** and detects the prop change ✅
7. **Component state resets** (search, filters, pagination) ✅
8. **Fresh data is fetched** for the new organization ✅
9. **Lists update** to show new organization's data ✅

## Pages Fixed

- ✅ **Main Tenders Page** (`/dashboard/tenders`) - TenderList now refreshes
- ✅ **Clients Page** (`/dashboard/clients`) - ClientList now refreshes
- ✅ **Submitted Tenders Page** (`/dashboard/tenders/submitted`) - Uses specialized SubmittedTenderList

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

### Tenders Page

1. **Go to `/dashboard/tenders`** with some tenders in Organization A
2. **Switch to Organization B** using the team switcher
3. **Verify**:
   - Stats cards update immediately ✅
   - Tender list refreshes to show Organization B's tenders ✅
   - Search box clears ✅
   - Status filter resets to "All Statuses" ✅
   - Pagination resets to page 1 ✅

### Clients Page

1. **Go to `/dashboard/clients`** with some clients in Organization A
2. **Switch to Organization B** using the team switcher
3. **Verify**:
   - Stats cards update immediately ✅
   - Client list refreshes to show Organization B's clients ✅
   - Search box clears ✅
   - Pagination resets to page 1 ✅

### Submitted Tenders Page

1. **Go to `/dashboard/tenders/submitted`**
2. **Switch organizations**
3. **Verify**:
   - Shows only submitted tenders by default ✅
   - Can filter to see pending tenders ✅
   - List refreshes for new organization ✅

## Files Modified

- `src/components/tenders/tender-list.tsx` - Added organization switching support
- `src/components/clients/client-list.tsx` - Added organization switching support
- `src/components/tenders/submitted-tender-list.tsx` - New specialized component for submitted tenders
- `src/app/dashboard/tenders/submitted/page.tsx` - Updated to use SubmittedTenderList

This fix ensures that when you switch organizations, all list components across the application properly refresh to display the new organization's data, providing a consistent and seamless user experience! 🚀

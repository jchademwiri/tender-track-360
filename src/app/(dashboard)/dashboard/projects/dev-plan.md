Documentation Updates

Update API documentation
Update user guides
Add troubleshooting guides
Deliverable: Production-ready settings system with comprehensive organization management

Technical Implementation Strategy
Leveraging Existing Code:
Use existing getorganizations() - already includes userRole and memberCount
Use existing invitation system - inviteMember(), cancelInvitation(), etc.
Use existing permission system - src/lib/auth/permissions.ts with manager role
Use existing organization components - from src/app/(dashboard)/organization/
Role-Based Permission Logic:
const canEdit = ['owner', 'admin', 'manager'].includes(userRole);
const canDelete = userRole === 'owner';
const canManageMembers = ['owner', 'admin', 'manager'].includes(userRole);
const canInviteMembers = ['owner', 'admin', 'manager'].includes(userRole);
Navigation Structure:
/settings (simplified main page)
├── /settings/overview (dashboard with quick links)
├── /settings/profile (existing - unchanged)
├── /settings/organisation (enhanced multi-org management)
└── /settings/notifications (existing - fix button types only)
Data Flow:
Fetch user organizations → getorganizations()
Display with role indicators → Role-based UI components
Organization selection → Navigate to management interface
Member management → Use existing invitation system
Organization operations → New server actions with permission checks
Each phase is designed to be independent and deployable, ensuring the system remains functional throughout development. The approach leverages your existing robust organization and invitation system while adding the enhanced settings interface you need.
